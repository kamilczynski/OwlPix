# ðŸ¦‰ OwlPix - YOLO Annotation Rotation Tool 

## Project Description  
OwlPix is a Python-based GUI application designed for rotating images and their corresponding YOLO annotations. It enables users to quickly process datasets, ensuring proper bounding box alignment after rotation. This tool is essential for data augmentation in deep learning applications. 

## Key Features  
- âœ… **Batch Image Rotation â€“ Rotate multiple images and their YOLO annotations at once.
- âœ… **Supports 90Â°, -90Â°, and 180Â° rotations â€“ Ensures accurate transformation of bounding boxes.
- âœ… *YOLO Annotation Handling â€“ Automatically recalculates bounding box coordinates post-rotation. 
- âœ… **Modern UI â€“ Built with customtkinter, featuring an intuitive dark mode interface.  
- âœ… **Folder Selection â€“ Easily choose input and output directories for batch processing.


## Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.12**  
- **OpenCV (cv2)** â€“ Image processing and transformation
- **CustomTkinter** â€“ Modern GUI elements
- **Pillow (PIL)** â€“ Image handling for background display
